Implement a data structure, **DsExample** with the following methods: 

- **size** which returns the number of elements in its collection
- **add** which adds an element to its middle when the collection size is even or the end when odd.
- **remove** which removes and returns the element at the end of the collection
- **toString** which pretty-prints the elements
